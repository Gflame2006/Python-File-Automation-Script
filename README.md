# Python-File-Automation-Script
An automated script to organize messy directories by file type. Written in Python using OS and Shutil libraries

Project Title: Automated File Organizer

What it does:
This Python script automates the process of digital decluttering. It scans a target directory, identifies file formats (Images, Docs, Installers), creates categorical sub-folders, and sorts the files automatically.
Why I built it:
I noticed that manual file management is time-consuming and prone to error. I wanted to create a solution that saves time and keeps local environments clean for better productivity.
